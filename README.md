# FoodTruckProject
This project is meant to resemble a basic application in which the program takes in data from the user and assigns it to a selection of up to 5 food trucks. From there, the following menu gives the user a chance to pick between 4 options.

TO USE: Follow prompts in console to input data for up to 5 trucks, can optionally input quit when prompted for a food truck name to exit and continue on to the next menu. From there select whether you would like to either display all of the trucks, the average rating of the trucks, display the highest rated truck, or quit the program completely. 

This program utilies only one static method (the Main). Another primary piece of code used in this program is an array, which correlates to a constructor method and gather data for the trucks. Getters and setters are used with a toString to display data on the trucks. I also made use of a switch, multiple for loops, and multiple if statements that worked in junction with the for loops.

This project was a struggle for me, but I learned a lot in the proccess. Using and implementing constructor methods really helped me to understand how they work, I found it a challenge to implement all od the mutliple technologies within the same program and get them to all work together. The hardest part me per usual was just getting started and knowing what steps I needed to take, I struggled with how to implement user input within an array, but it was great practice and I feel much more comfortable with arrays now I can say that with confidence.
